Terraform configuration for connecting two AWS VPCs using a Transit Gateway, as described in my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/connect-two-aws-vpcs-terraform-transit-gateway-guide-jovanovski-pte0f/?trackingId=RZfA4FnTRC%2BsGqjIFmL33g%3D%3D).

## Files

2. Download main.tf and output.tf from this repository.
3. Update main.tf with your values for key_name = "Key's name" (lines 84 & 154) and iam_instance_profile = "Role's name" (line 87).
